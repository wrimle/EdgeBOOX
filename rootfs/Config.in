            This is the location where the toolchain will be installed.  The
            toolchain will not work if it is moved from this location.
            Therefore, if you wish to package up a uClibc toolchain, it is
            important that is is set to the final location where the toolchain
            will be used.

            Most people will leave this set to the default value.
